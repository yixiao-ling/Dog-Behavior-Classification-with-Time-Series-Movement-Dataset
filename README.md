In this project, I work on the Dog behavior (Time Series) dataset in Kaggle. Firstly, I conduct data cleaning, exploratory analysis and feature engineering. Then, I applied Random Forest Classifier, Multi-layer perceptron, GRU, Simple CNN and ResNet to make prediction. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on all of the models. Model performances were evaluated through accuracy and recall. I also used resmapling techniques such as SMOTE to overcome class imblanace problem.
